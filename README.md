> A curated list of papers, code, and resources for **one-step diffusion models** — methods that turn noise into high-quality samples in a *single* neural network forward pass.
>
> Unlike most lists that simply split work into "native vs. distillation", this list is organized by the **core mathematical principle that makes one step generation possible**. Within each principle we then separate 🟢 **native** (from-scratch) and 🔵 **distillation** (teacher-dependent) variants.

## 🧭 Classification Rationale

Fast-sampling research has historically been catalogued either by application (text-to-image, super-resolution, video) or by a coarse *native vs. distillation* dichotomy. Both axes obscure the deeper question: **what mathematical mechanism actually collapses an iterative sampler into one step?** This list answers that question by grouping methods according to their *primary theoretical contribution*.

This taxonomy is grounded in recent unifying literature. **Uni-Instruct** (NeurIPS 2025) shows that a large family of one-step diffusion methods — DMD, SiD, Diff-Instruct, score-based and variational approaches — are all special cases of **diffusion divergence minimization**, differing only in the choice of divergence. This motivates our dedicated *Distribution Divergence Minimization* category with sub-axes for Forward KL, Reverse KL, Fisher divergence, and variational bounds. **One Step Diffusion via Shortcut Models** (ICLR 2025 Oral) explicitly frames direct noise-to-data mapping as a distinct paradigm separate from trajectory-based reasoning, justifying the *Shortcut / Direct Mapping* category. And **iCT** (ICLR 2024) demonstrates that consistency *training* (CT) and consistency *distillation* (CD) are two regimes of one principle — self-consistency along the PF-ODE — motivating our native/distillation split *inside* each principle rather than across the whole list.

We classify each paper by its **primary contribution**. Many works combine several principles (e.g. adversarial losses layered on score distillation); cross-references are added where a method materially spans categories. Within every category, entries are ordered chronologically (oldest → newest) so the conceptual lineage is easy to follow.

| Legend | Meaning |
|:------:|---------|
| 🟢 **Native** | Trained from scratch / teacher-free; one-step is a native training objective |
| 🔵 **Distill** | Distills a pretrained multi-step diffusion teacher into one/few steps |
| 🟡 **Hybrid** | Supports both native training and distillation |

## Consistency Models

> **Core principle — self-consistency along the PF-ODE.** Any two points on the same probability-flow ODE trajectory must map to the *same* endpoint. Enforcing this consistency constraint lets a network jump directly from noise to data. Following iCT, the principle admits both consistency *training* (CT, 🟢 native) and consistency *distillation* (CD, 🔵 teacher-based).

## Flow Straightening

> **Core principle — straighten the transport path.** If the trajectory connecting noise and data is (close to) a straight line, a single Euler step approximates the full ODE integration.

## Distribution Divergence Minimization

> **Core principle — minimize a statistical divergence between distributions.** These methods train the one-step generator so that its output distribution `p_θ` matches the target distribution `p_target` by minimizing some divergence `D(p_θ ∥ p_target)`. As shown by **Uni-Instruct** (NeurIPS 2025), DMD, SiD, Diff-Instruct and many others are special cases of a single *diffusion divergence minimization* framework; they differ chiefly in **which divergence** they minimize. We organize them along that axis.

### Forward KL / Regression

> Minimizing the forward KL `D(p_target ∥ p_θ)` is mode-covering and reduces to maximum-likelihood / regression-style objectives.

- **Progressive Distillation** is catalogued under [Related Resources → Foundational Works](#foundational-works), since its core contribution is *step compression* rather than a divergence-minimization result.

  Maximum-likelihood (forward-KL) distillation via an Expectation-Maximization formulation.

### Reverse KL / Distribution Matching

> Minimizing the reverse KL `D(p_θ ∥ p_target)` is mode-seeking; in practice it is estimated through the score functions of the real and the generator ("fake") distributions.

- **One-step Diffusion with Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)** [CVPR 2024] 🔵
