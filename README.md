> A curated list of papers, code, and resources for **one-step diffusion models** — methods that turn noise into high-quality samples in a *single* neural network forward pass.

## 🧭 Classification Rationale

Instead of the usual *native vs. distillation* split, we group methods by **the core mathematical principle that collapses iterative sampling into one step**. Each paper is placed by its *primary contribution*, with cross-references for works that span multiple principles.

| Legend | Meaning |
|:------:|---------|
| 🟢 **Native** | Trained from scratch / teacher-free; one-step is a native training objective |
| 🔵 **Distill** | Distills a pretrained multi-step diffusion teacher into one/few steps |
| 🟡 **Hybrid** | Supports both native training and distillation |

## Consistency Models

> **Core principle — self-consistency along the PF-ODE.** Any two points on the same probability-flow ODE trajectory must map to the *same* endpoint. Enforcing this consistency constraint lets a network jump directly from noise to data.

## Flow Straightening

> **Core principle — straighten the transport path.** If the trajectory connecting noise and data is (close to) a straight line, a single Euler step approximates the full ODE integration. Rectified-flow and flow-matching methods learn or refine such straight paths so that one-step Euler ≈ the complete ODE solution.

## Distribution Divergence Minimization

> **Core principle — minimize a statistical divergence between distributions.** These methods train the one-step generator so that its output distribution `p_θ` matches the target distribution `p_target` by minimizing some divergence `D(p_θ ∥ p_target)`. As shown by **Uni-Instruct** (NeurIPS 2025), DMD, SiD, Diff-Instruct and many others are special cases of a single *diffusion divergence minimization* framework; they differ chiefly in **which divergence** they minimize. We organize them along that axis.

### Forward KL / Regression

> Minimizing the forward KL `D(p_target ∥ p_θ)` is mode-covering and reduces to maximum-likelihood / regression-style objectives.

- **Progressive Distillation** is catalogued under [Related Resources → Foundational Works](#foundational-works), since its core contribution is *step compression* rather than a divergence-minimization result. It is cross-referenced here because its regression-on-teacher objective is forward-KL in spirit.

- **Score identity Distillation (SiD)** [ICML 2024] 🔵  
  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04057)] [[Code](https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD)]

  Self-adversarial flow framework without fixed auxiliary models for one-step generation.

---

## Shortcut / Direct Mapping

> **Core principle — learn the noise-to-data map directly.** Rather than reasoning about trajectories or iterative denoising, these methods propose a new paradigm: a single conditioned network that maps noise straight to data, bypassing the ODE/SDE machinery entirely.

- **One Step Diffusion via Shortcut Models** [ICLR 2025 Oral] 🟢

---

## Drifting Models

> **Core principle — evolve the generator's output distribution during training via Wasserstein gradient flow.** Instead of iterating at inference time, drifting models introduce a "drifting field" that continuously pushes the generator's output distribution toward the data distribution during training. At inference, a single forward pass suffices. Theoretically equivalent to minimizing KL divergence via Wasserstein-2 gradient flow and secretly performing score matching under Gaussian kernels.
